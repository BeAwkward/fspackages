# Features

## Synthetic Vision
            
* Added airport signs which show where airports are in 3d and can be toggled on/off
* Added horizon headings which show headings at 30 degree increments on the horizon and can be toggled on/off

## Airways

* Airways can be selected for a waypoint on the flight plan
* Will show a UI where you can select the airway and an exit
* Updates to show the route in real time

## Procedure Pages

* See the procedure in realtime when choosing a procedure and transitions
* Alternate transitions are also visible in a dimmed colour

## Direct TO

* Now supports the course parameter
* Choiose a course oher than the default to create a user waypoint 100nm from the location in the direction specified
* Very useful for VFR landings

## Others

* Units can be selected for a variety of data types which is reflected across the majority of the UI on both the PFD and MFD

# Enhancements

* Accuracy of the flight path marker has been greatly improved
* Hand made input component for ICAOs, numbers, drop down boxes, switches, buttons, strings, confirmation windows and times that are a lot more responsive and functional
* Soft key buttons highlight when clicked (mostly, needs some work still)
* Adjusting volume now briefly shows the volume value

## Transponder

* Coloured correctly for mode
* Auto selects ALT mode upon take off #240
* Reply status indicator (faked for realism)
* VFR can be set to 1200 or 7000 from the MFD settings page #233

## Local Time

* Support for 12/24 hour local time and Zulu/UTC time

## HSI Indicator

* CDI needle and bearing arrow both now transition smoothly when nav source is changed
* Colours correctly updated for nav source on bearing - #236
* Course adjuster for setting VOR bearings now has new logic for incrementing the value, making it easier to be more precise when spinning rapidly

## OAT

* Celsius / Farenheit support via MFD settings

## Barometric Pressure

* Support for InMG and HPA

## MFD Data Bar 

* Data bar is fully customisable from the new settings page. Currently supports: BRG, DIS, DTK, ETA, ETE, FOB, FOD, GS, TAS, TRK and XTK

## Settings Page

* Settings page added which has most of the functionality of the real G1000. The following settings are functional:
    * All unit selections
    * Data bar values
    * Channel spacing
    * VFR default squawk

## Flight Plan

* Support for wide and narrow view modes, with the following extra fields on the wide view: ETE, ETA, Fuel and Bearing

## Nearest Waypoint Pages

* Now shows a line from your position to the highlighted waypoint

# Visuals

* Rebuilt styling to closely match the real thing.
* In many places a sans-serif font has been chosen as it can be a little easier to fit larger text in to make it easier to read. This is a little different to the real thing but was done for improving the sim experience

## PFD

* Increased accuracy of font sizes and positions
* Added outlines, etc around parts of the instruments

## Attitude Indicator

* Ratio between above and below the horizon mroe closesly matches reality
* Amount of visible graduations changes realistically depending on whether synthetic vision is enabled

# Performance

* Whole UI has been rebuilt with a performance first mentality
* Potentially runs at full speed in under 1ms for both panels other than occassional spikes
* Can expect 5-10fps improvement in a cpu bound scenario
